Using V3.js for Frontend

    Library => vant, pinia, axios;

   whenevers api uses  => 1. state => to declare varible for using (response, error, errorMessage, errors)
                          2. getters => to reuse the values from state, (getResponse, geterror, getErrorMessage, geterrors)
                          3. actions => include method which is used from Frontend, (async get()) 



            1. state() => ({
                response: null, 
                error: null,
                errorMessage: null,
                errors: [],
             })
            2. getters: {
                getResponse: (state) => state.response,
                getError: (state) => state.error,
                getErrorMessage: (state) => state.errorMessage,
                getErrors: (state) => state.errors, 
              }
            3. actions:{
                async get()
              }


The difference between => export default userPortalAxiosInstance ; and export { name };


export default userPortalAxiosInstance => When we write the import => import userPortalAxiosInstance from "@/userPortalAxiosInstance";


in which  "userPortalAxiosInstance" the name which can be changed as you like in import so, the name is not fixed.

export { name }; => when you do not want to change the name , you can onlu use this name.
